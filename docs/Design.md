## Overview

KEROC is designed to be a high-performance programming language with syntax similar to Python. The main objectives are ease of use and fast execution speed.

## Architecture

The compiler consists of several key components:

- **Lexer**: Converts source code into tokens.
- **Parser**: Parses tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Code Generator**: Translates the AST into executable code.

### Lexer

- **Functionality**: Tokenizes source code into meaningful symbols.
- **Implementation**: Uses regular expressions to identify different types of tokens.

### Parser

- **Functionality**: Parses token sequences to generate an AST.
- **Implementation**: Uses recursive descent parsing techniques.

### Code Generator

- **Functionality**: Converts the AST into machine code or intermediate code.
- **Implementation**: Generates optimized code for fast execution.

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficiency**: The lexer and parser are optimized for speed and low memory usage.
- **Code Generation**: Includes optimizations to ensure the generated code runs efficiently.

## Future Enhancements

- **Extended Syntax**: Support for additional programming constructs.
- **Library Integration**: Include standard libraries and modules.
- **Improved Debugging**: Tools for better error handling and debugging.
